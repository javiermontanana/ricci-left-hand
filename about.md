This website is a transcription of the book *Left-Hand Violin Technique*, by Ruggiero Ricci. 

![Book cover]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/book-cover.jpg)

It is built with the website builder [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) using the [Ed theme](https://minicomp.github.io/ed/). You can view the source code in the [github repository](https://github.com/javiermontanana/ricci-left-hand). 

The examples were engraved using [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/), and then included in the HTML code as SGV files. [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/) is a programme for engraving music where the user writes music by entering text. If you're interested in using Lilypond, you'll probably also want to use the editor [Frescobaldi](https://www.frescobaldi.org/).

The book is transcribed verbatim with a few small changes: 

- In the printed book, the chapter structure is not very clear so I've made my own interpretation of Chords being the first chapter and Shifting being the second, each with three sections. 
- In a couple of places I've added subheadings for grouping the examples by keys. 
- Where the numbering of examples seemed inconsistent, I've made up a numbering. 
- In the chapter Left Hand Pizzicato, the examples are very long. I have listed them but not transcribed them. They are printed in the book, but if you're interested, you can find the music those elsewhere. 

Other than that, all the content in the book is transcribed here.
