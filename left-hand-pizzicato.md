title: Left Hand Pizzicato
---

Left-hand pizzicato is one of the best exercises possible for the development of the left hand because the normal procedure is reversed and the fourth finger is used most often. The third and second fingers are next most used. The first is used the least. Hence, we are developing the weak part of the hand. This technique serves more as a finger developer than double stops (chords) do because the fingers are doing double work. 

When beginning, one should practice this technique only a few minutes, otherwise the fingers will become blistered. Do not attempt to break the strings with force. Start softly and concentrate on evenness. After the fingers are more calloused, increase the length of practice time and volume. Ten minutes practice a day makes a great difference.
