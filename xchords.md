Chord practice has long been an accepted method for the improvement of weak left hands and fingers, as well as for improving the hand position. But the practicing of chords also serves another important purpose. It increases the demands on the ear. This positive effect of chords is readily noticeable in fine string quartet players. They generally have goood intonation, since in order to play in tune ther are constantly forced to adjust to each other. 

Single-note practice is of limited benefit to a violinist for intonation, since it does not have a fixed pitch from which to measure. Consequently, a violinist may practice single-note scales for years and never really develop a precise ear. It is possible to begin a scale in A major and end on a B flat or an A flat if there is not point of (tonal) reference. One has only to study the Caprices of Paganini to realize that his approach was chordal, an approach that was perhaps influenced by the guitar. The single-note scale system is inefficient, since there is no way of checking the intonation from note to note. Intonation, therefore, must be based on a chordal-key relationship. 

This ear-training phase is generally neglected with students and is therefore the starting point of this text. The building of intonation throught the building of a chord (double-stop) is where the building of a solid left-hand technique really begins.
