title: "The Chordal Concept: Left Hand Expansion"
---

So far, the discussion and examples for the left hand have been basically within the frameworl of the interval of a fourth, or the double stop of an octave (first and fourth finger). To advance one's technique, a player must now think, listen, and perform in the context of the interval of a fifth. We will call this a "chordal" concept. 

In order to better understand the benefits of a chordal approach, we will imagine a violinist with five fingers instead of four. Let us see what could be done. Thirds could be played as follows. 

#### ex 45

The same with fingered octaves:

#### ex 46

#### ex 48

{% include examples/the-chordal-concept/ex48.svg %}

Thus three double stops instead of two can be played before shifting, an advantage of 50 percent. 

Obvoiusly we cannot graft on another finger but we can obtain five finger benefits from four by trying to keep the interval of fifth within our grasp (the root, third and fifth of a chord). The following example demonstrates that we can encompass this chordal outline with four finger. The fifth finger is held down (e and b) to check intonation, and fingers two and three can be altered as a finger exercise.

This is an excellent exercise for beginning the expansion of the left hand, since it concentrates on the inner two fingers of the left hand but does not cause the tension found in fingered octaves and tenths. 

With the chordal concept there is the possibility of (1) developing intonation by holding the fifth (the b serves as the drone); (2) gently expanding and strengthening the left hand and (3) actually thinking in terms of a chordal outline. This approach is an excellent preparation for pasages such as the following from Caprice No. 14 by Paganini.

This preparation is vital if one intends to play technically difficult works, since Paganini makes demands far beyond this in all his Caprices. The following is a more extreme example. One finger is held down while the rest of the hand expands into another position. 

#### ex 51

#### ex 55

{% include examples/the-chordal-concept/ex55.svg %}

#### ex 56

In example 51 the first finger is held down and in Examples 54, 55 and 56 the thirds or fourth finger is the anchor. 

The following examples (examples 57 through 61) are designed to help the left hand expand to the interval of a fifth and beyond. This is an important procedure in developing a "chordal concept".
