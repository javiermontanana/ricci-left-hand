title: Shifting

There are three thypes of shifting: crawling, pivoting, snd the basic shift (glissando). Crawling occurs when the fingers precede the thumb; pivoting when the thumb remains in position and the hand rotates to another position, then returns to the former position. The basic shift involves the movement of the entire hand and arm as one unit. We will discuss the basic shif first because with this type of shift a particular approach is often neglected. 

There are many violinists who perfect this:

But neglect this:

And this

Learn the fingerboard horizontally as well as vertically.

In practicing a series of short shifts (glissando scale), one has less tendency to create unsmooth or abrupt shift. (This is a common problem.) One can and should practice the double stop glissando on every finger. 

Unless one has a highly developed shifting or glissando technique, this transportation will have to be made for convenience rather than for musical reasons. Especially in cantinella sections, this weakness will be verty obvious. One has only to look at the works of Paganini and Wieniawksi or Ernst to realize that they had highly developed glissando technique.

## Crawling 

When employing the technique of crawling, it should be noted that the fingers precede the thumb. This is useful in avoiding a direct shift when the phrase demands a smooth continuity. Here are two examples 80a and 80b. Example 80b can be called a shiftless scale!

#### ex 80a

#### ex 80b

This should be practiced in order to make one more conscious of half-steps. 

## Pivoting

Another important aspect of shifting lies in the much-neglected technique of pivoting. When pivoting, the manner of holding the violin changes. The center of balance is more on thumb (which acts as an anchor) than at the chinrest. The following is a typical passage for pivoting in the Nineteenth Caprice of Paganini: 

#### ex 81

{% include examples/shifting/ex81.svg %}

Here no shift takes place. The thumb remains in the third position. It is important that the finger rest more on the pad than on the tip. In order to spread the fingers sideways, or close the spread, it is necessary to rest more on the pad of the finger. With the finger arched in a "V" shape, the spread is very constricted. When spreading the fingers in a horizontal motion, keep one finger as an anchor. 

There are many technical passages where it is advisable to make a particular position the base of operation. The third position is the most common for one can rest the hand against the shoulder of the instrument and extend back to first position as well as to the higher positions. It is possible to span the full length of the fingerboard from low A on the G string to the top A on the E string without shifting. This position is not advisable in melodic passages, but in rapid technical ones it is important to cover a long distance in the most economical way. A local hand movement is much safer than a major movement involving the entire arm. By keeping the thumb in the middle of the hand, there is and octave spread on one string.
