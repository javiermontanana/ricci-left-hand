As a concert violinist for more than half a century and a teacher for the past decade, I have listened to thousands of violinist. They have often asked me how I am able to execute particularly difficult technical passages. They have asked for my secret, as if there were some magic involved. No magic can transform a player into an instant Paganini; there are many elements which must be approached with intelligence, discipline, and the patience necessary to achieve a particular technical skill. I believe, however, that the way practice time is spent and how technical problem are analyzed is of critical importance. If there is a secret, it lies in efficient practice. 

There are many problems involved in the developmnet of the left hand, and it is not the intention of this volume to relate to each technical aspect in a step-by-step procedure. Rather, this text deals with the basic concepts that underlie the building of an advanced left-hand technique. 

These concepts deal not only with the training of the hand but with the training of the ear as well. Throughout the discussions, intonation must be the primary factor, for no technique has any value if the music it produces is out of tune. 

This volume is dedicated to helping violinists develop a solid left-hand technique, so secure that there are no technically limiting factors that will interefere with interpretive freedom. I have supplemented the text with examples from the literature plus exercises which I have devised for specific purposes. They are intended to serve as a basis from which the student can explore, experiment, adapt, or create variations which will serve his own personal needs. 

I owe the inspiration for many for many of the concepts in this volume to the monumental solo literature of Bach, Paganini, Ernst, Wieniawski, and Ysa√øe. I urge you to study these particular works well, since the contain practically all of the technical material essential to the art of violin playing.
