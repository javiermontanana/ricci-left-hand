## The chin rest and other aspects

Virtuosi of the Nineteenth Century managed very well without a chin or shoulder rest. Today if a violinist did not have such security at the chin his/her left hand would have better contact with the instrument. For these devices give a false sense of security, and the left hand becomes reckless, the cause of most miscalculations. 

I am not advocating their elimination, although the shoulder rest is indeed a clumsy appendage. But I do suggest that the violinist should guard against clutching the violin with the chin and shoulder. The violin should rest on the shoulder and in the hand. The chin should be over the center (tailpiece). The instrument rests between the thumb and the index finger and will not fall unless the violin loses contact with the left hand. Take time to find the most comfortable way of holding your instrument. It is better to bring the violin in toward the center of the body. With the chin turned toward the left shoulder for long periods there is a greater likelihood of developing neck and spinal problems. Keep the chin more toward the center and listen more with the left ear. 


## Left hand position and arm motion 

To form a good left-hand position, place all four fingers on the string, then slide them up in a straight line to the highest position. Practice this on each string. When playing, strive to play more on the pads of the fingers, not so much on the tips, and keep the fingers near the string. Hand position technique:

Practicing exercises in fifths in Example 70 is a real help to the hand position. There is really no fixed position for the thumb. Let it fall in the most natural position, depending on the finger pattern. 


## Endurance

Because each ascending octave on the violin contracts, causing a new problem in spacing and in intonation, most of the scale exercises should be played full circle. Start in different keys and persist as the difficulty increases. While repeating two-bar patterns or short examples countless times may serve to solve certain isolated problems, one does not acquire the necessary endurance. Once the hand gets tired, intonation disappears. Sequences are a boring but very efficient system, if memorized. Attention should be focused entirely on intonation, not reading notes. 


## Vibrato

The vibrato motion generates from the lowest knuckle of the finger. It is produced by bending this knuckle in and out. The rolling motion of the finger should be done very slowly at first, flatting the main pitch - never sharping it- otherwise it will give the aural impression of being the next half tone higher. If too much pressure is exerted on the finger, it will snap of click and an even roll will not be achieved. Any hand or arm movement must stem from the finger (knuckle). Success depends mainly on achieving the correct angle of the finger and developing an even, automatic roll. LEan the finger back (toward the scroll), not forward. Utilize the pad of the finger. This can be found more easily with two fingers down. For this reason, practice in sixths. Learning vibrato is a difficult and time-consuming process; there is no quick method. In time, the correct motion will become automatic. 

One on the most difficult techniques in violin playing is using the right amount of vibrato and keeping it going. Most violinists have a stop-and-go vibrato; it only pertains to long notes and stops on eighths. Once good control of vibrato and its various speeds is achieved, it not only will enhance the sound but serve to keep the left hand from becoming stiff. This is particularly important in double-stop playing, but should only be administered after the intonation is secure. For those with a good arm vibrato, none of this applies, but it tends to cause stiffness and shifting problems.

## Vibrato Study

Tilt the hand back toward the pads. Too much pressure will make a snap instead of a roll in the joint. The angle must be correct. This is a difficult motion to learn and will take a few weeks. There is no arm motion; just fingers and wrist. Put the fingers on the lower note and roll up. You will probably have the correct angle this way. Experiment. It is easier to start with sixths since the fingers support each other. The width and speed of the vibrato are extremely important: in the upper positions faster and narrower; in lower positions, wider and slower. The most common problems are: starting the vibrato after beginning the note or using it too much on the third finger, sometimes on the first finger and none on the fourth when it is needed most on the top note. For fingers 2 and 3 begin:

Do not keep the first finger down for third - or fourth - finger vibrato or the hand will be tied up. For technical passages, the hand should be parallel with the neck, and for cantinela passages the hand should be at a “V” angle from the fingerboard. 

After you have learned this motion - and patience is required - even out the roll so that it is not so square. Narrow the motion down to a quarter tone (more or less). 


## Practice time 

How much time should be devoted to scales alone? For the student with an untrained ear, perhaps ten minutes on fifth scales, thirty more on scales in thirds, ten on glissando scales - one octave in keys of G, D, A, and E, sustaining the open strings underneath, and five on pizzicato. The most common mistake is to learn a scale or exercise, then learn another and forget the exercise you played before. Play in a chromatic sequence, and keep adding the next scale. 



## Practice prescriptions for the left hand

For intonation: constant vigilance. From chords or double stops. Play more on the pads of the fingers. Check yourself with open strings. 
For weak hands: practice pizzicato, fingered thirds and octaves. 
To improve sound: glissando thirds, sixths and octaves. 
To improve sound: glissando thirds, sixths and octaves, with non-stop vibrato.
To relieve hand tension: vibrato.
To improve shifting: put the scroll against the wall; if it moves, you are shifting too hard. 
To improve the trill: pizzicato and short tension trills. 
For better independence of fingers: left-hand pizzicato.
For smooth shifting, practice harmonics. It is not necessary to use more pressure than one uses on the stopped note.
In technical passages, the left hand should keep in close contact with the instrument (fingerboard). A chord outline or finger pattern should encompass the passage. Shift only when necessary. Use extensions instead of shifting whenever possible. 
In melodic passages, disregard the old rule of keeping your fingers down. Free the hand. 
Keep the joints of the fingers back from the tip at a “V” angle. Push up from behind, not out from the side.
On slurred passages, put your fingers down more percussively. This gives clarity and rhythmic control. 
Check slurred passages by playing them spiccato. This will show up any unevenness. 


## Closing comments

This book began - and concludes - by stressing the importance of developing good intonation. You must learn to listen to yourself critically. Learn to use your own ear. Do not become dependent on your teacher, but constantly check yourself by utilizing drones and common pitches. Think in terms of chords. With this approach you can build solid intonation. To quote Pablo Casals, “Intonation is a matter of conscience.” It is also a matter of patience and perseverance - and is the crucial factor in the development of a left hand technique.
