This website is a transcription of the book *Left-Hand Violin Technique*, by Ruggiero Ricci. 

![Book cover](/assets/book-cover.jpg)

It is built with the website builder [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) using the [Ed theme](https://minicomp.github.io/ed/).

The examples were engraved using [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/), and then included in the HTML code as SGV files. [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/) is a programme for engraving music where the user writes music by entering text. If you're interested in using Lilypond, you'll probably also want to use the editor [Frescobaldi](https://www.frescobaldi.org/).
