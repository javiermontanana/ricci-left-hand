title: The Drone Scale

To maintain the key when practicing scales, a drone tone creating a double stop should be utilized in order to guard against faulty intonation. The following scale example demonstrates this approach. 

#### ex. 1

This is a G major scale with open-string drones. The open stirngs must, of course, be in tune. This approach is extremely important and should be an integral part of the dily practice of scales and the literature. 

### Examples in G major

The following examples in G major show various ways in which the open-string drone can be applied to scale and arpeggio exercises.

### Exmples in A major 

Sometimes and open-string drone is not possible. We then need to 'fix' the pitch in the ear by retaining a note with the finger. In the G major scale, (Example 1) we did this wen we plac3ed the fourth finger D matching it with the open D and holding it down until we left the D string. 

In the following two examples, the octave A's are interchanged with the open A and are checked against each other.

### Transposeable examples

When one plays in a key which cannot utilize open strings in order to check the intonation, the basic chord outline of the key and its common pitches seve to fix the pitch in the ear. In Example 41 note the held Fs and D flats. With the B flat, they constitute the tonic chord of the scale (B flat minor). 

#### Ex. 41

##### Chordal outline

{% include examples/the-drone-scale/ex41.svg %}

#### Ex. 42

##### Arpeggio

{% include examples/the-drone-scale/ex42.svg %}

#### Ex. 43

##### Scale

{% include examples/the-drone-scale/ex43.svg %}

This order of (1)  chordal outline, (2) the arpeggio and (3) the scale is what the player must keep in mind. This is usually practiced in reverse: the scale first and so forth. Thus we never emphasize the chord aspect of which serves to help the intonation as well as the placement of the left hand. I cannot suggest strongly enough the importance of this appeoach.
