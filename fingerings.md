Most technical passages can be broken down into patterns or chords, and here the extension of the hand should be utilized so s to cover as much space as possiible without shifting. This continual striving for greater extensions is more efficient and seves to increase technical facility by decreasing excess motion. When it is not possible to avoid shifting entirely, then one must select one that involves the least motion. Think of the chord, arpeggio and scale order, but not in single notes. The second finger, not the first, should become the anchord finger. Perceive the fingerboard in a chromatic sequence. Then, in many cases, we need only move the hand up a half tone. For example, if one can play a B-flat major scale, the why not a B major scale and so forth? The fingering is the same for every scale that follows. The fingerings should suit the musical ptter. The shift should be on the pulse note when there is a choice. Do not shift on the off beat.

In cantabile playing, continuity is a problem. Too much finger pressure will cause a smear instead of a  connection. 

The fingering *below* the music in the following example is by Paganini. Note the usage of glissando fingering (2-2, 4444!) It make sense.

In the high positions it is better to use a glissando technique. 

#### ex 84

##### Paganini - Moses Fantasy

It is much esier to use the third finger instead of the fourth in the high positions, since the fourth finger necessitates bringing the elbow out further.

Preventive measures are a good idea. Therefore, practice scales and arpeggios with different fingerings even if you have a preference for one. In performance, you may accidentally use a wrogn fingering and you must learn to adjust immediately. 

In the music of Vivaldi, one often finds scales beginning on the next note in succession. Try to fit the fingering to the pattern, as in the following example.

Shift with the pattern.

Always analyze and search for patterns. Become interval conscious. Study the following permutations. Notice that no shifting takes place, only a change of fingering.

The following examples are constructed to force the ear to work when untypical or no pattern exists. This can be the case in much twentieth century literature. (Exx. 90 and 91)

When analyzing technical passages, here are some shifting and fingering guidelines to keep in mind.

- Keep in position as lonf as possible by using chordal outlines. 
- Keep in position by using extensions. 
- Shift on the same finger. 

Try to keep the hand in the most natural and comfortable position. Think harmonically, always striving to form chords or double stops. Check you intonation constantly, using a fixed pitch or open string.
