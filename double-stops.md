There are many instances when we must play thirds with various finger combinations (1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-4, 3-4, 2-3). (See example 61.) Such fingerings demand the expansion as well as the conctraction of the left hand, and it is necessary to achieve this flexibility.

If I had to choose only one technical exercise, it would be scales in thirds. I find this even better than fingered octaves where the lead fingers are one and two. In thirds, it is the third and fourth fingers.The short Sevcik-type exercise is excellent for working out difficulties, but to develop the hand ond forearm, we need a longer sequence both for intonation and shifting. Practice glissando scales in thirds with the first and third fingers and also the second and fourth. Use minimum pressure. Too much pressure causes stiffness and loss of flexibility. High strings increase intonation problems considerably.

When practicing glissano thirds or any of these glissando examples, at first do so in the following manner

#### ex (62aa)

Play one octave up on the two strings and then down. Finger, but do not play the top line. Now do the opposite: play the top string. You are playing a C major scale with two fingers.

When stretching the hand (octave, fingered octaves, tenths, and beyond) begin by placing the fourth or top finger down first. Then draw the hand back to the first or lower finger. In extreme stretches, the first finger should be as straight as possible, not hooked. This allows for a considerably larger extension.

It is clear from the above examples that glissando scales are a true short cut. They give us a better measure of distance that is, more shifting practice on every note. 

When playing the scale with one finger, 50 percent of a scale is played in sixths, thirds, fifths, octaves and tenths.

It is not such a great step from a one-finger scale to an advanced technique.
